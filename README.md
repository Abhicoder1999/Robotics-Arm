# Robotics-Arm
A Smart Robotics Arm controlled by servos through Computer Vision & Machine Learning application

The aim of the project is to provide a efficient computer vision based approach to mimic the action of the human by a distant robotics arm. This method makes a non-contact way to estimate the pose of the hand of a person. Application of the system can vary from surgical robotics, Industrial Robotics and Rehabilitation Engineering
